    "Bus – Represents intercity travel (e.g., Daewoo Express)\n",
    "Train – Represents railway travel (e.g., Pakistan Railways)\n",
    "Airplane – Represents air travel (e.g., PIA – Pakistan International Airlines)\n",

    "Polymorphism allows objects of different subclasses (Bus, Train, Airplane) to be treated as objects of a common superclass (Transport).\n",
